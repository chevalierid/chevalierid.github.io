## How does artificial light at night affect ground-dwelling insects?
_Thesis project for MSc in Plant Science, University of British Columbia (2022-2025), co-supervised by Dr. Juli Carrillo and Dr. Quentin Geissmann_

Artificial light at night is growing at an astounding rate. As historically dark areas become perturbed by brighter and bluer lights, the daily rhythms of many life forms may change in unprecedented and poorly understood ways. I designed and deployed stations with sensors and lights in two colours, then captured ground-dwelling arthropods while rotating light treatments across the sites.

I had the chance to talk about this issue in several media appearances, including a French-language interview on [Radio Canada]([url](https://piee-lab.landfood.ubc.ca/research/examining-effects-of-artificial-light-at-night-on-insects-and-bats/)).

We built a flexible enclosure with integrated sensing to keep a pediatric transplant heart beating and monitored outside the body during transport. I led our team of 4 students in collaboration with surgeons and engineers at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children.

## Optimising a new hemostatic agent
_Co-operative work position at the Department of National Defence, Toronto, Canada_

I characterised and improved a treatment to stop bleeding during non-compressible hemorrhage using ELISA, gel electrophoresis, and thromboelastometry tests. These results were presented at Military Health System Research Symposium 2019 & published in two Defence Canada reports (below).

I have a diverse set of interconnected research interests! I started out with a strong motivation to improve human health, which I explored through co-op and research positions in my biomedical engineering degree at the University of Waterloo. I then took a year of unclassified studies at the University of British Columbia to learn more about the environment and society, through which I developed a passion for ecology. I chose to follow this passion into my Master's at UBC, during which I studied the effects of light pollution on ground-dwelling arthropods.

Right now, I am really motivated by projects that bring these interests together by aligning environmental health with human health. I am currently seeking a PhD position and would be especially interested in studying the health effects of radioactive waste generated by oil and gas extraction and disposed of via injection wells.
